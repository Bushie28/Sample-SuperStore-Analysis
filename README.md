# Sample-SuperStore-Analysis

# Project Description
It shows an American online superstore that sells various things like furnitures, office supplies and some technology and other accessories. The csv files shows the data relating to the online warehouse and it shows the state,region, discounts and the total profits. I am going to collate all of this data to show the stakeholders the necessary information they will need to understand what is going on in the company. The result of this analysis should show the stakeholders the states/region that buy the most popular categories and the states that buy the least and the categories that should be pushed to them.
